        Day 1
        Continued west into <a href=nook.html>Nook</a> [2,2]. 
        Found key on table. 
        Found paintings of stairs and stars (I). 
        Nook has two exits SE. (maybe I should use top, bottom, left, right notation? NESW changes depending on orientation)
        Found A journey noteworthy (+ small text.)
        Found lockbox next to lazy boy.
